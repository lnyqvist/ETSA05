\maketitle


\begin{abstract}
This document is a template. The various components of your paper (title, headings, etc.) are already defined on the style sheet, as illustrated by the portions given in this document.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
%The introduction section can be used to introduce the company in general or to introduce the purpose and context of this report. This template is a document that provides the predefined outline of your group essay from the seminar compendium. If you want to change or adjust your outline, you must do so before the outline is due (March 30, 2012). It is important to not that you have a page limit of 5-7 pages for your final report (which is due May 11, 2012), hence it is important to decide how much should be analyzed, discussed, and written for each section.

\section{Description of the System}
iOS is an operating system for mobile devices developed by Apple Inc. It is based on Apple’s desktop operating system OS X but has been reinvented for mobile devices \cite{apple_ios}. iOS had a market share of 23.8\% according to Gartner - counting worldwide smartphone sales to end users by operating system \cite{gartner_market_share}.Prior to June 2010, iOS was known as iPhone OS and was thus originally developed for the iPhone.  iOS is mostly built on proprietary software and no other than Apple are allowed to use iOS on their devices. As of 2012, four categories of iOS-devices exist: iPhone (smartphone), iPod touch (portable media player / personal digital assistant), iPad (tablet computer) and Apple TV (digital media receiver).

\section{Quality Characteristics}
%Under this section you should discuss which quality characteristics are particular important for this system. Which quality characteristics are considered most important, i.e. prioritize among the relevant quality characteristics, and provide a rationale for the prioritization. In addition, from which perspective is the prioritization important. You find the quality characteristics in the ISO 9126 standard in one article, e.g. \cite{jung2004} in the articles course compendium. The prioritization can be performed at the characteristics level and/or at the sub-characteristics level.

\section{Availability for Disabled}
%Here you should provide a discussion/analysis of which aspects of availability for the elderly, disabled, and individuals with special needs are current interests. Analyze how can Information and Communication Technology (ICT) help people with disability. However, if your system is not applicable for people with disabilities, analyze the system with respect to accessibility with respect to general human-computer interaction. 

\section{Ethical Aspects}
%Which ethical questions must be answered for the system? Here you should identify, and discuss, ethical dilemmas/potential ethical issues related to your system. Examples of different kinds of ethical dilemmas can be found in Berenbach and Broy \cite{berenbach2004}.

\section{Legal Aspects}
%In this section you should discuss and analyze which legal aspects, e.g. intellectual property, are relevant for your system.

\section{Financial Asps2ects}
% Under this section financial aspects should be analyzed and discussed. What are the financial driving forces in favor of and against your system? Who are the investors, who can make a profit, what is the cost for the individual, and what is the cost for society? Which business model is used for your system, and what investment strategy is used (short-term or long-term)? These questions are examples of what can be analyzed with regards to financial aspects. 

\section{Summary}
%In the summary section you should summarize what your report is about ands present your main findings/consequences.
